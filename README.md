# 🏥 Patient Sentiment and Satisfaction in Healthcare  
**Uncovering Insights through NLP, LLMs and Predictive Analytics**

## 📌 Project Summary

This project explores the intersection of patient sentiment and satisfaction within healthcare services. Using two complementary datasets — one containing free-text hospital reviews and the other structured patient satisfaction data — the goal is to extract actionable insights that support smarter, data-driven decisions in the healthcare industry.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Apply **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to classify patient reviews by sentiment and identify common topics and concerns.
- Correlate unstructured sentiment data with structured patient satisfaction indicators (e.g. wait times, service quality).
- Develop a **predictive model** to estimate satisfaction scores using selected patient and service features.
- Create an **interactive dashboard** with Power BI or Tableau.
- Demonstrate how AI can enhance healthcare feedback analysis and ultimately improve patient experience and outcomes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Transformers, XGBoost
- **NLP & LLMs**: Hugging Face, spaCy, OpenAI API
- **Visualization**: Power BI / Tableau, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Jupyter Notebooks**, Git/GitHub
